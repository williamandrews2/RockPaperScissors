# RockPaperScissors

## Introduction
Simple rock paper scissors game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game can be found live [here](https://williamandrews2.github.io/RockPaperScissors/).

## How to Play
Upon loading onto the site (or live server if you have the repo on your local machine), there are rock, paper, and scissor icons. You can click one of these to "choose
your weapon against the computer. The first one to 5 wins is declared the winner.

## How it works
Each rock, paper, and scissor icon is set to use your input against the computer's choice to determine a round winner. The computer's choice is made by using 
a simple random number function. Messages are displayed after each round and at the end of the 5 rounds. These are all done by manipulating the DOM.

## Known issues
* Not mobile-friendly
* Footer is inconsistent, does not stay at the bottom 100% of the time.
